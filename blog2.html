You believe in the saying "less is more" and tend to keep things subtle yet stunning. Just like your choice in fashion or interior design, you gravitate toward simplicity and tranquility. Your friends admire your ability to make any situation calm and graceful. In Cakelia, your cake would have soft hues, elegant shapes, and a restrained, sophisticated charm. Think pastels, geometric shapes, and a touch of gold.</p>
            <p class="text444"><strong>Personality Trait:</strong> Quiet, thoughtful, and efficient. You like things streamlined and effortless but with a touch of class.</p>
            
            <h2 class="subtitle444">2. The Over-the-Top Creator</h2>

            <p class="text444">For you, a cake isn’t just a dessert; it’s a piece of art inspired by nature. Think rustic, earthy tones, delicate flowers, and textures that mirror the beauty of the natural world. You’re grounded, peaceful, and value authenticity in every aspect of life. Cakelia could design a nature-inspired cake with blooming flowers, textured fondant that resembles tree bark, and natural color palettes like olive greens and soft browns.

            <h2 class="subtitle444">4. The Quirky Innovator</h2>
            <p class="text444">You love the weird and wonderful, and your cake design shows it!
